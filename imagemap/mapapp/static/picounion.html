    Pico-Union, located immediately west of Downtown Los Angeles, is one of the city's most historic and densely populated neighborhoods, with over 40,000 residents.
 The area was originally home to the Tongva village of Geveronga, which was destroyed in 1781 by Spanish settlers during the Anza Expedition.
 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Pico-Union developed as a middle and upper-middle-class residential district, attracting affluent homeowners due to its proximity to downtown and the Wilshire District.
 Many of the neighborhood’s homes were built between 1880 and 1930, and a significant number of residences date from before 1939, contributing to its historic character.

After World War II, like many inner-city neighborhoods, Pico-Union experienced a decline as residents moved to the suburbs, leading to high vacancy rates and decreased property values by the 1960s.
 The neighborhood underwent a major demographic shift starting in the late 1970s and 1980s, when it became a primary point of entry for Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants fleeing civil wars.
 This wave of immigration established a strong Central American cultural presence, with El Salvador being the most common place of birth among foreign-born residents at 44.4% in 2000.
 The area now reflects a rich multicultural mix, including Mexican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan, and more recently, Korean and white populations as adjacent Koreatown expands and younger professionals move in.

As of the 2000 U.S. census, the population was 42,324, growing to an estimated 44,664 by 2008, with a median age of 27, considered young for Los Angeles.
 The ethnic composition in 2000 was predominantly Latino (85.4%), followed by Asian (7.6%), white (3.0%), Black (2.9%), and others (1.1%).
 More recent data from City-Data.com indicates a population of 28,444, with 73.3% Hispanic or Latino, 12.8% Asian, and 5.6% White, reflecting possible shifts or differing boundary definitions.
 The neighborhood has a high rate of foreign-born residents (64.6% in 2000), a high average household size of 3.3, and a high percentage of renters (90.5%).

Pico-Union became the city’s 19th Historic Preservation Overlay Zone in 2004 and contains two National Register-listed historic districts: the South Bonnie Brae Tract and Alvarado Terrace Historic Districts.
 In 2012, a portion of Vermont Avenue was designated the El Salvador Community Corridor, and parts of the neighborhood are being considered for recognition as The Central American Historical District.
 The area continues to evolve, balancing historic preservation with changing demographics and rising property values.
