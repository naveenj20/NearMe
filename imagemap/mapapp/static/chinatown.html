    Chinatown in Los Angeles is a historic neighborhood located in Downtown Los Angeles, California, established as a commercial center for Chinese and other Asian businesses in 1938.
 This area, known as "New Chinatown," was built after the original Chinatown, located near the current site of Union Station, was demolished to make way for the city's major transportation hub.
 The original Chinatown, established in the late 19th century, was a vibrant community that thrived from the 1890s to the early 1910s before being displaced.
 The relocation was prompted by a 1931 Supreme Court ruling that approved the condemnation of the old neighborhood.

<br>
New Chinatown was developed through community efforts led by Chinese-American leader Peter Soo Hoo Sr., incorporating a blend of Chinese and American architectural styles.
 The design was influenced by Hollywood film set designers, resulting in a "Hollywoodized" version of Shanghai, complete with themed streets like Bamboo Lane, Gin Ling Way, and Chung King Road.
 The neighborhood's centerpiece is Central Plaza, which features a statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, a 7-foot statue of Bruce Lee unveiled in 2013, and a dragon mural painted by Tyrus Wong.
 The area is also marked by the Dragon Gate, or Chinatown Gateway Monument, on North Broadway, which is illuminated at night.

Chinatown spans less than one square mile and is bordered by the Los Angeles River to the east, Dodger Stadium and Chavez Ravine to the north, Beaudry and Figueroa streets to the west, and Cesar Chavez Avenue and the Civic Center to the south.
 The neighborhood is home to approximately 7,800 residents, with a population that is predominantly Asian (68.8% in 2010) and includes a significant Latino population (14.7%).
 The median household income is among the lowest in Los Angeles County, and a large percentage of residents live in rental housing.
<br>
<br>
The area is known for its diverse culinary offerings, ranging from traditional Cantonese and Teochew cuisine to Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian food.
 Notable dining spots include Phoenix Bakery, which has been serving its famous strawberry whipped cream cake since 1938
 , and Majordomo, the first West Coast restaurant from Momofuku chef David Chang, offering Korean-meets-California cuisine.
 The Far East Plaza food mall is also a popular destination, housing a variety of restaurants and food vendors.
<br>
<br>
Chinatown features over 20 art galleries showcasing modern and contemporary works, many by emerging artists.
 The Chinese American Museum, housed in the historic 1890 Garnier Building—the oldest surviving structure from the original Chinatown—offers exhibits on Chinese-American history and culture.
 The neighborhood also hosts major cultural events, including the Lunar New Year Parade and the Lantern Festival.
<br>
<br>
Despite its cultural significance, Chinatown has faced challenges, including concerns over gentrification, rising rents, and the displacement of long-time low-income residents.
 Some residents and observers have noted a decline in vibrancy in recent years, with reports of businesses closing and the area feeling less active.
 However, it remains a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, offering a unique blend of history, art, shopping, and dining.
 The neighborhood is easily accessible via the Metro L line, which has a station located directly in Chinatown.
