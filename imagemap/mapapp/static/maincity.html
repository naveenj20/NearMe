    Los Angeles, the second most populous city in the United States, is located in southern California, situated between the Pacific Ocean and the San Gabriel Mountains.
 The city spans approximately 466 to 503 square miles, featuring diverse landscapes that include beaches, mountains, valleys, and urban neighborhoods.
 It lies within a seismically active region due to its proximity to the San Andreas Fault, making it vulnerable to earthquakes, and also faces increasing threats from droughts, wildfires, and other natural disasters.

The history of Los Angeles begins with Indigenous peoples, particularly the Tongva, who inhabited the region for thousands of years before European contact. By 3000 BCE, Hokan-speaking peoples occupied the area, later replaced by Uto-Aztecan-speaking Tongva, who called the region Yaa.
 The Tongva lived in sophisticated trading networks and relied on natural resources, including the freshwater aquifer of the Los Angeles River, which later supported Spanish colonization.
 The first Europeans to visit were Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542 and Sebastián Vizcaíno in 1602, but permanent non-native presence began with the Portolá expedition in 1769.
 On September 4, 1781, 44 settlers from New Spain (modern Mexico), known as the Pobladores, founded the pueblo of Los Angeles under the direction of Spanish Governor Felipe de Neve, following the Spanish colonial Laws of the Indies.
 The settlement was officially named either "El Pueblo de la Reina de los Angeles" or "El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de los Angeles de Porciuncula," a matter of historical debate.

After Mexico gained independence from Spain, Los Angeles remained under Mexican rule until 1849, when it became part of the United States following the Mexican-American War.
 The arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1876 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885 triggered a population boom, drawing settlers from the Midwest and East Coast, especially during a fare war that lowered travel costs.
 The discovery of oil in 1892 launched an economic boom, transforming the city's economy.
 In the early 20th century, Los Angeles evolved from a small frontier town—marked by lawlessness and ethnic conflict, including the 1871 Chinese Massacre—into a major urban center.

The city's economy has historically been driven by agriculture, oil, real estate, and manufacturing.
 By the mid-20th century, it was the most productive agricultural county in the U.S., though urban sprawl has since reduced farming activity.
 Today, the service sector dominates, encompassing business and professional services, health care, finance, trade, and tourism.
 Los Angeles is home to the busiest port complex in North America, the combined ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which are vital to Pacific Rim trade.
 It is also the largest manufacturing center in the United States, with strong industries in aerospace, technology, fashion, and entertainment.
 If Los Angeles County were a country, its economic output would rank among the world’s highest.

Los Angeles is globally renowned as the center of the American entertainment industry, particularly Hollywood, which attracted filmmakers in the early 1900s due to favorable weather, diverse scenery, and non-union labor conditions.
 The city remains a hub for film, television, music, and digital media, shaping global culture.
 It will host the Summer Olympics for the third time in 2028, having previously hosted in 1932 and 1984.

Culturally, Los Angeles is a mosaic of ethnicities and languages, shaped by waves of immigration from Mexico, Asia, and other regions since the 1960s.
 It is known for its racial and cultural diversity, often described as a melting pot, with large Hispanic, Asian, African American, and immigrant communities.
 However, this diversity coexists with significant economic disparities, influenced by historical practices like redlining and ongoing gentrification.
 The city’s lifestyle is automobile-dependent, favors single-family homes, and embraces informality, with a horizontal skyline compared to other major U.S. cities.
