    Boyle Heights is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, located east of the Los Angeles River and situated at the eastern boundary of the city, bordering the City of Vernon to the south, East Los Angeles to the east, Lincoln Heights and El Sereno to the north, and downtown Los Angeles to the west.
 It covers approximately 6.5 square miles (17 km²) and had a population of 92,785 as of the most recent data.
 The neighborhood is known for its rich history and cultural diversity, having been a center for Mexican, Jewish, Japanese, Russian, Armenian, African American, and other immigrant communities throughout the 20th century.
 It has been historically referred to as the “Ellis Island of the West” due to its role as a gateway for new immigrants. <br>

Boyle Heights is one of the city’s most notable and historic Chicano/Mexican American communities, home to cultural landmarks such as Mariachi Plaza and the annual Día de los Muertos celebrations.
 The area was originally known as Paredón Blanco during Mexican rule and later became home to Tongva refugees from the village of Yaanga in 1845.
 The neighborhood was renamed for Andrew Boyle, an Irish immigrant who purchased land there after the Mexican–American War.
 In the early 20th century, it became a significant center for Japanese American life, including churches, temples, and a hospital designed by architect Yos Hirose.
 The neighborhood also hosted a vibrant Jewish community before a shift toward a predominantly Latino population.<br>

<br>
As of the 2020 census, Boyle Heights was approximately 95% Latino, making it one of the most homogeneous neighborhoods in Los Angeles.
 The community has experienced significant gentrification pressures in recent years, leading to protests and cultural concerns, themes reflected in media such as the TV series Vida and Gentefied.
 The area is also known for its working-class character, with challenges including high traffic congestion from the East LA Interchange, air pollution, and limited city services.
 The neighborhood is highly transit-accessible, with access to the Metro Gold Line and proximity to downtown Los Angeles.<br>

Boyle Heights has a complex history of social and political solidarity across racial and ethnic lines, with residents forming unified communities despite periods of upheaval, including the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and the Cold War-era anti-Communist campaigns.
 The neighborhood is also home to the Boyle Heights Museum, an online platform dedicated to preserving and sharing the area’s multi-ethnic history.
 Despite its cultural richness, some residents and visitors note safety concerns, particularly related to gang activity and shootings, though many report feeling safe if they remain cautious and respectful of the community.
