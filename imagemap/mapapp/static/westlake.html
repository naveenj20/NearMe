   Westlake is a densely populated, urban neighborhood in Central Los Angeles, California, developed primarily in the 1920s on land once referred to as the "southwest quarter" of the city in 1887.
 The area was named after Westlake Park, now known as MacArthur Park, which was established on land donated by Canadian physician Henricus Wallace Westlake, who built his home on Burlington Avenue around 1888, the first residence in the rolling hills west of the cityâ€™s core.
 Initially one of the first residential areas west of Figueroa Street, Westlake became a desirable enclave for wealthy businessmen who commuted to downtown, Hollywood, and Wilshire Center, living in elegant Spanish Revival and Art Deco mansions.

In its early years, Westlake had a significant Jewish population, and the northwestern blocks bordered an early working-class Filipino community displaced from Little Tokyo and Bunker Hill in the 1940s.
 The neighborhood faced early industrial challenges, including pollution from oil drilling in 1899, which residents protested due to runoff and unsightly derricks.
 A city ordinance restricting drilling near the park was upheld in court, but by 1900, the oil reserves were depleted.
 In 1919, plans for a large garment factory were withdrawn after community opposition.

Over time, demographic shifts transformed Westlake. The white middle and upper classes gradually moved to areas like Encino and Westwood, leaving behind aging housing stock.
 In the 1980s, the neighborhood saw an influx of refugees from Central America, particularly El Salvador, due to civil conflict.
 This led to the emergence of the MS-13 gang, contributing to rising crime and social challenges by 1990, when the area was marked by gang activity, drug use, and informal economies.
 Sidewalk vending flourished, often under extortion by gangs, and many alleys became unsafe, housing homeless populations amid deteriorating conditions.

However, by the late 2000s, crime had declined significantly due to anti-crime initiatives, especially around MacArthur Park, including the installation of surveillance cameras in 2004 and the formation of a business improvement district.
 Rising rents in Downtown and Koreatown attracted artists and creative professionals, leading to gentrification marked by swanky nightclubs, art galleries, and organic food co-ops.
 A 2012 city ordinance attempted to regulate sidewalk vending by banning utilitarian goods but allowing art sales, though enforcement has been inconsistent.

Demographically, Westlake is predominantly Latino, with 85% of residents speaking Spanish at home.
 It has a young population, high renter occupancy (100%), and a large proportion of small apartments, with 99.4% of housing units being one, two, or no bedrooms.
 The neighborhood has a high foreign-born population (57%) and a low car ownership rate (49.1% of households are car-free).
 Despite economic vitality, it faces significant poverty, with 54.1% of children living below the federal poverty line.
 Recent years have seen a public health crisis due to the opioid epidemic, particularly fentanyl overdoses around MacArthur Park, exacerbated by homelessness and synthetic drug availability.
