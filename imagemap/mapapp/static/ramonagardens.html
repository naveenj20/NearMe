   Ramona Gardens is a public housing project located in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East Los Angeles, California. Established in 1941 by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) with federal support from the United States Housing Authority (USHA), it was part of the New Deal-era public housing initiative aimed at providing affordable, safe housing for low-income families. Originally named Ramona Village, the project was renamed Ramona Gardens before opening to avoid confusion with a private development. Designed by the firm Housing Architects Associated—which included notable architects like Lloyd Wright and Eugene Weston Jr.—the development was built on 32 acres and initially contained 610 units. It was one of ten HACLA projects constructed between 1941 and 1943 and stood out for being racially integrated at a time when most public housing was segregated.

The first residents, many of whom were displaced from substandard “slum” housing, moved in during January 1941, with rents ranging from $11 to $18 per month, inclusive of utilities. The project was officially dedicated on February 22, 1941, with California Governor Culbert Olson and Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron in attendance, highlighting its significance as a model for urban public housing. Over the decades, Ramona Gardens evolved into a predominantly Latino community, becoming a cultural and familial anchor for generations of working-class immigrants.

Today, the development comprises approximately 500 units and is home to over 1,700 residents. More than 60% of households earn less than $20,000 annually, and about two-thirds include children, reflecting the community’s deep roots in family life despite economic hardship. The neighborhood has long been associated with the Big Hazard street gang, leading to challenges with gang violence, drug activity, and strained police relations. However, residents have consistently demonstrated resilience and strong community organizing.

A major ongoing concern is environmental injustice. Ramona Gardens is bordered by the I-10 Freeway, warehouses, and industrial facilities, exposing residents to high levels of air pollution and associated health risks, including asthma and other respiratory conditions. In response, community members—particularly women and youth—have led grassroots efforts to improve living conditions. Organizations like Legacy LA have spearheaded initiatives such as a community garden (built on raised beds due to soil contamination), an open-air market for local vendors, and youth-led research to advocate for a long-proposed community park.

In 2014, the community faced a traumatic incident when several apartments were firebombed in a racially motivated attack, targeting African American residents. Fortunately, no one was injured, but the event underscored the vulnerabilities faced by marginalized communities. Despite these challenges, Ramona Gardens remains a testament to perseverance, cultural identity, and the power of collective action in the fight for dignity, safety, and environmental justice in urban America.
